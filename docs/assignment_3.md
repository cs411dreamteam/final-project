# CS411 Team Assignment 3 - Technology Stack

Section A4 Group 2

## Node.js

We chose Node.js primarily because we had seen examples of it in lecture already, and also because with javascript across the whole stack, we would all be using the same language, which will encourage teamwork by making it easier to help each other when somebody is stuck. We also believe that the asynchronous nature of Node.js will allow us to process incoming request while the I/O operation is taking place. This event driven I/O will allow us to build a higher performance and scalable application since we can always process requests without having to wait for read and write operations.
