The user will be able to input parameters on the main search page in order to find a meal at a restaurant that fits such parameters.

User will type the name of a food, max budget, location (or allow the app to find their location), max distance, and then select one of the following from a drop down menu: max/min calories, max/min protein, max/min carbs, or nearest food item. The app will then find one meal at a restaurant within the given parameters (under budget, within distance, related to food type, etc) that maximizes the chosen dropdown option. For instance, user will type "chicken, $10, Allston, 1 mile, max calories" and then the app will return a chicken-related meal at a restaurant within 1 mile of Allston that contains the highest amount of calories under 10 dollars.
