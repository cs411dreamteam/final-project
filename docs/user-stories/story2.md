Link to Website

As a logged-in user, I want to be able to access the link to the website of the restaurant I choose, so that I can explore more information about the restaurant.

Acceptance criteria

Given that I’m a logged-in user, when I click on the website link of the description page of a restaurant, the system will direct me the website of the restaurant by using the default browser. When I click the ‘Close’ button, the system should redirect me to the original description page.
