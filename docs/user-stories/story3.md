# User Story 3
Any user will have the option of logging in through a third party so that they can save their favorite searches and results.

## Description
Upon any user-specific action, such as trying to save a search result or trying to open the user profile page, the user will br prompted to sign in via Twitter, Facebook, or Google (undetermined yet). After signing in, a user profile will be created in the app's database and the user can perform user-specific actions like saving or reviewing their search history on the user profile page, which is detailed in User Story 4. If signing in is unsuccessful, then the user is returned to the previous page without having completed the user-specific action.
