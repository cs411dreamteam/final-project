# User Story 4
A logged in user will be able to open up the user profile page and view their saved items and search history in addition to redoing old searches.

## Description
Clicking a tab at the top of the main page will open the user profile page. If the user is logged in, as detailed in another user story, then this page will open and display all data specific to this user. On this page will be several tabs: firstly, the user can browse their previous searches. Each search history item will display the meal that was returned, and also include a link to the website of the restaurant at which the meal can be found. This search history will cut off after a certain number of searches, so the user can choose to save their favorite searches which will be stored forever. Upon completing a search, the user can select a "favorite" icon near the name of the food, and if the user is logged in, then that food will be saved on the user's profile page under the "saved" tab.

Additionally, when browsing previous searches, each search will include a "redo" option. When the user selects this, then the main search page will be opened again, but the selected search's information will now autofill all of the search parameters. The user can then make changes if they want before they select search.
