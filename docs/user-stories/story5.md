# User Story 5
After searching for what kind of food I want, I would like to see the results and see which food is gluten-free, vegan, etc.

## Description
After user inputting on the main search page, users can tell which food is gluten-free, vegan, etc, on a result page. Results have easy-to-tell indications of what is gluten-free, vegan, etc. For example, for vegan food, have a sticker-like indication next to the option, written "Vegan" with green color. 
API automatically generates the food type based on the user-input string. Based on the food type automatically generated from the API, the resulting food options have indications.

## Update (4/21/2019)
Unfortunately we were not able to implement this user story because the API we used for nutrition information, Edamam, does not give information on whether or not a meal is gluten-free or vegan.  Also, since different restaurants use different ingredients for their meals it is impossible to know for sure whether a dish is gluten-free or vegan.
