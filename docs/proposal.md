# CS411 Team Assignment 1 - Proposal

Section A4 Group 2

## Idea 1 

An app that, when given a food preference and choice to either maximize the calorie to money or money to calorie ratio by the user, will search for all nearby restaurants, poll their menus for something related to the given food, and compare that calorie/money ratio with similar meals at other close restaurants before giving the user the best calorie/money ratio food item at a restaurant within the given distance.

## Idea 2

Similar to a generic mapping app, but in addition to their start and end location, the user also sets a "safety" tolerance. The app will use car crash and crime statistics to alter the ideal route to one that is safe enough to statisfy the user while still getting them to their destination in a reasonable amount of time. From a place of departure to destination, people can choose a route that is safest, which has seldom crime and crashed before.
