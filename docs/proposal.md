# CS411 Team Assignment 1 - Proposal

Section A4 Group 2

## Idea 1 

An app that, when given a food preference and choice to either maximize the calorie to money or money to calorie ratio by the user, will search for all nearby restaurants, poll their menus for something related to the given food, and compare that calorie/money ratio with similar meals at other close restaurants before giving the user the best calorie/money ratio food item at a restaurant within the given distance.
--a similar idea was to do something like this with the dining hall scheduling over the course of a week, but seeing as the dining halls lack an API that might be difficult, but we can discuss it if wanted.
## Idea 2

Similar to a generic mapping app, but in addition to their start and end location, the user also sets a "safety" tolerance. The app will use car crash and crime statistics to alter the ideal route to one that is safe enough to statisfy the user.
