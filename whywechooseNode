We all choose Node.js for our project since we have seen examples of it in class and all agreed that we would be more familiar with learning how to use Node.js, which uses common language of JavaScript.  We also believe that asynchronous nature of Node.js will allow us to process incoming request while the I/O operation is taking place. This event driven I/O will allow us to build a higher performance and scalable application since we can always process request without having to wait for read and write operations.
